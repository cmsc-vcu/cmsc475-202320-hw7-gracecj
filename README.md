Reflection was the prompt that immediately caught my attention. I found myself contemplating the various meanings of reflection. Self-reflection? Introspection? Mirrors? 

To gather inspiration, I examined other art forms and I found that the idea of reflecting on one’s life resonated with me. As I scrolled through paintings and poems, I noticed some common themes that guided me in the direction I wanted to go. Painters confront their mortality through self-portraits created during their final conscious moments, while poets describe their childhood memories to evoke a sense of reflection and introspection. Nature also plays a significant role, with bodies of water acting as mirrors that can reflect one’s younger self. The cycles of the sun and moon remind the artist that time is passing. Stars are often used to symbolize memories that endure even after a person has passed away.

Inspired by the idea of stars and memories, I hoped to design a canvas that immerses the user in a galaxy of stars. I started by finding code that allowed me to generate a randomized field of stars. I modified the code for the galaxy to add more random chance in the number of stars that are created. To make the canvas interactive, I also wrote code that lets the user add stars by clicking or dragging their mouse. After some trial and error, I created a function that draws clusters of stars around the user's additions, varying the number and density of stars for each new mouse event.
